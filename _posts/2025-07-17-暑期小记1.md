I walk alone, my soul frozen,<br>
Like this white, endless night.<br>
And in the silence, vast and deep,<br>
Only the fading echoes weep.<br>
<br>
The wind, a ghost, begins to keen,<br>
Through barren branches, stark and lean.<br>
It steals the breath I try to keep,<br>
And scatters memories in its sweep——<br>
Dead leaves, like hopes I could not reap,<br>
Now dance in darkness, lost and cheap.<br>
No warmth remains, no fire to leap,<br>
Just shadows where the cold does creep.<br>
<br>
The snow falls soft, a shroud so deep,<br>
On promises I could not keep.<br>
Each flake, a tear the heavens weep,<br>
On dreams now buried in their sleep.<br>
It muffles sound where secrets heap,<br>
And covers wounds that ache and seep.<br>
My footsteps mark a path so steep,<br>
A vigil only I will keep.<br>
<br>
The moon, a spectre, cold and pale,<br>
Casts light like ice on hill and dale.<br>
It shows the world in shades of grey,<br>
Where joy has long since fled away.<br>
The frozen river, hard as glass,<br>
Reflects a past that will not pass——<br>
The face once loved, now lost, alas,<br>
Beyond my reach, behind the glass.<br>
<br>
The wind returns with sharper spite,<br>
To snatch the echoes in the night.<br>
It whips the snow in swirling dread,<br>
Around this path where hope lies dead.<br>
The pines stand sentinel and groan,<br>
Like mourners chilled down to the bone.<br>
No star appears, no friendly stone,<br>
I face this emptiness alone.<br>
<br>
Oh, cruel the season, sharp the air,<br>
That strips the spirit bare, in despair.<br>
The crows above on black wings wheel,<br>
Their mocking cries the soul can feel.<br>
<br>
The frost has bound the earth so fast,<br>
This bitter chill will ever last.<br>
The weeping echo fades to past,<br>
Stolen by the icy blast.<br>
No sound remains, no sigh, no gasp,<br>
Just winter's unforgiving clasp.<br>
